# Onboarding
Onboarding procedure for new researchers in awegroup!

To make your research journey as smooth, fun and productive as possible, we kindly ask you to go through the following steps and apply what you learned throughout your research journey.

## Scientific language

- [ ] Notation
- [ ] Abbreviations and acronyms

## Illustrations, Figures, Images, Plots, etc.

- [ ] Check out: [figures_plots_illustrations_images](https://github.com/awegroup/Onboarding/blob/main/figures_plots_illustrations_images.md)


## Code
If working with code, make sure to scan through the [AWE Developer Guide](https://awegroup.github.io/developer-guide/), made specifically for this research group in collaboration with senior computer scientists from the [digital competency center](https://www.tudelft.nl/digital-competence-centre).

As a bare minimum, you should use: 
- [ ] Create a github repository, you could make use of our custom made [Python template](https://github.com/awegroup/template-python)
- [ ] Track your research using git by frequently (every day) making new commits and pushing your changes to the remote.

## Latex
For latex, you are free to choose any template.

But it would be best if you stick to some style guides:
- all subscripts should be in upright, so not $C_L$ but $C_\mathrm{L}$
- all numbers must be in mathmode, so not 4 but $4$
- units should not be m/s but $ms^{-1}$

etc.



## Literature
- [ ] For V3 related literature check the [TUDELFT_V3_KITE website](https://awegroup.github.io/TUDELFT_V3_KITE/)



## Resources
- [ ] Check out Roland's amazing [Airborne Wind Energy slides](https://awecourse.github.io/slides/), of which you can download the illustrations and images.
- [ ] Check out Roland's [3D kite viewer]( https://delftxtools.tudelft.nl/AE4T40_Airborne_Wind_Energy/threejs/kiteV3_static.html), of which you can save the image in SVG format.
