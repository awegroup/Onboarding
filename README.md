# Onboarding
Onboarding procedure for new researchers in awegroup!

To make your research journey as smooth, fun and productive as possible, we kindly ask you to go through the following steps and apply what you learned throughout your research journey.

## Scientific notation

- [ ] The [Reviews of Modern Physics Style Guide](https://cdn.journals.aps.org/files/rmpguide.pdf) is a good reference on scientific notation
- [ ] Subscripts that stand for abbreviations should be in upright, so not $C_L$ but $C_\mathrm{L}$
- [ ] Subscripts used for enumertations are italic ($a_i$ with $i=1, \ldots, N$).
- [ ] Numbers must be in mathmode, so not 4 but $4$
- [ ] Units in Roman upright font and should not be m/s but $ms^{-1}$ (Wind Energy Science style)

## Scientific language

- [ ] The [Appendix A of the Reviews of Modern Physics Style Guide](https://cdn.journals.aps.org/files/rmpguapa.pdf) provides suitable language advice.
- [ ] [Capitalization When Defining Abbreviations](https://www.aje.com/arc/editing-tip-capitalization-when-defining-abbreviations)

## Use of AI

- [ ] You can get an educational license for Github co-pilot, which will accelerate code development
- [ ] TU Delft offers educational license for Grammarly, accelerating text writing

## Illustrations, Figures, Images, Plots, etc.

- [ ] Check out: [figures_plots_illustrations_images](https://github.com/awegroup/Onboarding/blob/main/figures_plots_illustrations_images.md)
- Always include the (vector based) source of the illustration or part of it


## Code
If working with code, make sure to scan through the [AWE Developer Guide](https://awegroup.github.io/developer-guide/), made specifically for this research group in collaboration with senior computer scientists from the [digital competency center](https://www.tudelft.nl/digital-competence-centre).

**Minimum**
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository, you could make use of our custom-made [Python template](https://github.com/awegroup/template-python)
- [ ] Track your research using git by frequently (every day) making new commits and pushing your changes to the remote.

## Latex
Preferred is to use Overleaf (TU Delft has an institutional subscription). 

## Literature
- [ ] For V3 related literature check the [TUDELFT_V3_KITE website](https://awegroup.github.io/TUDELFT_V3_KITE/)



## Resources
- [ ] Check out Roland's amazing [Airborne Wind Energy slides](https://awecourse.github.io/slides/), of which you can download the illustrations and images.
- [ ] Check out Roland's [3D kite viewer]( https://delftxtools.tudelft.nl/AE4T40_Airborne_Wind_Energy/threejs/kiteV3_static.html), of which you can save the image in SVG format.
